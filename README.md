BITCORN explorer;
corntoshis vision realized

a Bitcorn Labs service

this git repo is for the production dapp found below:
https://suemn-5aaaa-aaaap-qb62q-cai.icp0.io

Recently, $GHOST has developed a service where users can deploy and then mint new tokens via their icpi.xyz dapp. This appears to have become immensely popular with traders and users of the internet computer.

Bitcorn Labs noticed that while these tokens are icrc1 standard and fairly advanced they lacked a block explorer and other infrastructure to effectively move about the ecosystem. So this dapp was introduced to produce tx URLs so tokens could be enabled on Openchat and other platforms that require a tx url.

Furthermore, this will allow users to query holders, and transactions because services like Icscan.io and ic.house do not pick up ICPI tokens effectively.

Bitcorn Labs hopes that this took enables users to research projects on ICPI as well as icpi developers to grow their projects within the internet computer ecosystem.

this dapp can 
-query token balances
-call tx's in a url format widely used across the IC

the code in this repo is the original dapp, based in sneed snoop. its configured in a format where it can be cloned and another cansiter can be inserted and it should would, albeit with an ugly ui. 

special thanks oss providers  Sneed Dao
special thanks to ghost team for candid interface instructions

-sneed dao provided the base code for the project directly with the sneed snoop fork
-the sns cansiter indexing tool from snassy.icp was also instrumental in the devlopment of the the main dapp
