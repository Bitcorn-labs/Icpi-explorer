BITCORN explorer

corntoshis vision realized,
currently, ICPI tokens are all the rage with a new generation of IC users.
a big issue for corntoshi is the lack of documentation or tooling this tokens have,
and thus they are likely to at best, fizzle out because they cannot move about the ic
ecosystem, or at worst are a hotbed for short term unethical actors lauching repetive
funnt logoed projects. the hope of this tool, once finished, is that users and devs
alike can feel comfertable utilizing icpi projects. 
this explorer produces transactuon urls which are nessascary for dapps like Openchat.
It also lets users query particular transactions and wallets.
