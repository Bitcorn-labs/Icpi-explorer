BITCORN explorer;
corntoshis vision realized

a Bircorn Labs service

this git repo is for the production dapp found below:
https://suemn-5aaaa-aaaap-qb62q-cai.icp0.io

Recently, $GHOST has developed a service where users can deploy and then mint new tokens via their icpi.xyz dapp. This appears to have become immensely popular with traders and users of the internet computer.

Bitcorn Labs noticed that while these tokens are icrc1 standard and fairly advanced they lacked a block explorer and other infrastructure to effectively move about the ecosystem. So this dapp (https://suemn-5aaaa-aaaap-qb62q-cai.icp0.io/ 3) was introduced to produce tx URLs so tokens could be enabled on Openchat and other platforms that require a tx url.

Furthermore, this will allow users to query holders, and transactions because services like Icscan.io and ic.house do not pick up ICPI tokens effectively.

below you will find the main production dapp.
